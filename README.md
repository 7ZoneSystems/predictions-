Prediction DAY (1/50)
## Disclaimer and Usage Notice

### Project Status

This system is currently under live public testing for a fixed evaluation period of 50 days.

All outputs, predictions, signals, and confidence metrics generated during this phase are part of an ongoing validation process and may change as the system evolves.

---

### Nature of Advice Provided

This project does provide market-related advice in the form of risk signals, growth signals, and probabilistic forecasts derived from historical data analysis and model-based inference.

The advice is intended to support decision-making as a supplementary signal, not as a standalone trading system.

---

### Trading and Risk Disclosure

Predictions and signals produced by this system must not be used as the sole basis for executing trades.

Users are required to combine these signals with independent analysis, risk management strategies, and personal judgment before making any financial decision.

Financial markets are inherently volatile, and losses are possible even when signals indicate favorable conditions.

---

### Responsibility and Liability

The author is not responsible for any financial loss, damage, or consequences resulting from the use of this software or its outputs.

By using this project, users acknowledge that all decisions made using the provided advice are taken at their own risk.

---

### Usage Restrictions

This project and all generated outputs are intended for personal and non-commercial use only.

Sharing, redistributing, or using the predictions, charts, or visualizations for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited without explicit written permission from the author.
